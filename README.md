# Advent of Code

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This repo contains all of my Advent of Code solutions using R. I’m using
this to practice programming and problem-based solutions, but it’s
mostly for a little holiday fun. I’m also using a custom repo badge that
scrapes a user’s Advent of Code star count and displays it as a badge.
