This is my personal repo for the Advent of Code 2020 solutions. I’m
using this to brush up on programming concepts and to just have fun. I’m
also using a custom repo badge that scrapes a user’s Advent of Code star
count and displays it as a badge.

Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions\!
